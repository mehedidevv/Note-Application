# Note Application


A Note Application built using Kotlin allows users to create, edit, and organize notes efficiently on Android devices. Utilizing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, it ensures clean separation between UI and data handling. SQLite Database is used for local storage, while LiveData observes data changes and updates the UI in real-time. Users can categorize notes, search through them, and pin important ones. Kotlin's concise syntax and modern Android libraries make it a highly efficient and maintainable solution for note-taking applications.
